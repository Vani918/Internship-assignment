                Persephone, the goddess of spring, serves as the heroine of the story set against
                the backdrop of the underworld. At first, she is shown as an innocent and naive 
                young woman, but her character evolves significantly as she confronts various 
                challenges. Portrayed with pink skin and a kind heart, she stands in sharp contrast
                to the unforgiving world of Olympus. Her journey involves discovering her own 
                strength and coping with the trauma of being assaulted by Apollo, along with her 
                complex emotions regarding the underworld.

                Dice: The Cube that Changes Everything, in particular, centres around the central 
                character, Dongtae. Initially, he begins as a shy high school kid who is a loser in 
                every aspect of his life. After being constantly mistreated and bullied, his life takes 
                a fortunate twist when he becomes a dicer. However, can he alter his whole life by rolling 
                a simple cube?
